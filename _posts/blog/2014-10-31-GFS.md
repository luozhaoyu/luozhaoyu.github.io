### Consistency model
* defined: a mutation succeed without interference from concurrent writers
    * it may include mingled fragments from multiple mutations
* consistent: all clients will see the same data
* A global mutation order is defined first by the lease grant order chosen by the master
    * then within a lease by the serial numbers assigned by the primary

### Reviews
* Application must cope with possible duplicates
* Not POSIX compliant
* No caching of data: streaming reads and appends are quick
* Checksum must be used along with Record Append
    * File contents must be verified to avoid inconsistent regions, repeated appends
