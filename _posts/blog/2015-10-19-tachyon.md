### Problem
* I/O is the bottleneck of a system
* Read is easy to deal with, but write operations could not scale-out due to multiple replication

### Solutions
* use memory to store most recent files
* don't do file replications
    * it would do checkpoints of all files
        * needed information is `lineage`: input file, binary programs, execution configuration, dependency type
        * discard old file versions after checkpoint
        * if file is too big to fit in memory, checkpoint leafs firstly during operation burst, then checkpoint the rest of non-leaf files
        * once one file have checkpoint, I could discard it from memory
    * but once the storage is down forever, it could not be recovered without previous backups or replications
