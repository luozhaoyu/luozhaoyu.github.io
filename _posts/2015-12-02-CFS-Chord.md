### What is the most important idea in the CFS paper that builders of modern distributed systems should know?
* As the scale increases in a distributed system, each node is not necessary to maintain a global view of the whole cluster
    * Even if the distributed system has a central server, it could not handle thousands of machines' constant pings
    * The CFS is clever that each server maintains only a logarithmic number of machines, since CFS imposes an ordering in its files (which seems like an index)
