### Logic
1. Represent world knowledge in logic
- Perform inferences; i.e. deduce what logically follows. Why?

* [first order predicate calculus (FOPC)] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic)
    * Seeing if a logical sentence is satisfiable
    * Seeing what logically follows from some given logical sentences
    * well defined
    * sound (inferences are correct)
    * complete (all possible deduction can be mechanically produced)
* [Propositional calculus] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus)
    * Components are Atomic Sentences: it is cold, it is raining, etc. P, Q, etc (evaluate to TRUE or FALSE)


#### Connectives create compound sentences
* If P and Q are logical sentences then so are
    * (P) - can add parens
    * ^P - negation
    * P^Q - conjunction
    * PvQ - disjunction
    * P=>Q - implication
    * P<=>Q - equivalence





    Truth Tables that Define the Connectiver

    P   Q   ^P  P^Q PvQ P->Q(**^PvQ**)  P<->Q
    F   F   T   F   F   T               T
    F   T   T   F   T   T               F
    T   F   F   F   T   F               F
    T   T   F   T   T   T               T

* R: it is raining, V: take umbrella
    * Translate: If it is raining, table your umbrella
    * Wrong R^U: it is currently raining and you should take your umbrella
    * Right R->: if it is raining, then you should take your umbrella

#### A grammatically correct logical sentence is called a [well formed formula (WFF)] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-formed_formula)
Some jargons

* a *model* is a "possible world" where the truth value of each primitive is given/specified
* a model of a set of WFF is one that makes all the sentences true
* a **valid** (or [tauta logical] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(logic)#Background)) WFF is true in all world states
* a **satisfiable** WFF is true in at least one world state
* an unsatisfiable WFF is never true

        WFF     Valid   Satisfiable Unsatisfiable
        P               if p=true
        Pv^P    Yes
        P^^P                        Yes

Is (P^Q) -> (PvQ) valid, satisfiable or unsatisfiable? show via a truth table

    PvQ is the same with [^(P^Q)]v[PvQ]

    P   Q   (P^Q)   (PvQ)   P^Q->PvQ
    F   F   F       F       T
    F   T   F       T       T
    T   F   F       T       T
    T   T   T       T       T

    So (P^Q) -> (PvQ) is valid

##### Using Search to Find What Logically Follows
Task: Given WFF1, WFF2 ... WFFn, show WFFz

1. Viewing as a search space
* using valid logical operatori (i = [1, n])
* Keep going until we add WFFz

* Theorem proving called "model checking" in computer security
* Inference rules

#### [Natural Deduction] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_deduction)

* Deduction ins Propositional Calculus
    * Notation, if we believe these WFF(s) |- then these WFF(s) logical follow
    * [|- sequent calculus] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequent_calculus#Natural_deduction_systems)
* AND Elimination (AE)
    * (a1 ^ a2 ^...^ an) |- ai, i means All items in an AND are true
* AND Introduction (AI)
    * (a1, a2, a3,..., an) |- (a1 ^ a2 ^...^ an)
* OR Introduction (OI)
    * alpha |- (alpha v beta), for any WFF beta
* Double-Negation Elimination (DNE)
    * ^(^alpha) |- alpha
* Double-Negation Introduction (DNI)
    * alpha |- ^(^alpha)
* [Modus Ponens (MP)] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens)
    * (a -> b, a) |- b
    * (^a v b, a) |- b
* Unit Resolution (UR)
    * (a v b, ^b) |- a
* Resolution
    * (a v b, ^b v c) |- (a v c), via "cast analysis" of b being true of false
    * (^a v b, ^b v c) |- (^a v c), if we preprocess our "givens" we only need this inference rule
* Equivalence Elimination (EE)
    * a <-> b |- (a->b) ^ (b->a)
* Some Implicit Rules
    * a ^ b |- b ^ a
    * a v b |- b v a
    * a |- (a)
    * (a) |- a

##### Example
Given:

1. P
* !Q
* P->(R ^ W)
* (R ^ !Q)-> S

show **S**:

    WFF         Justification

    P           Given
    !Q          Given
    P->(R^W)    Given
    (R^!Q)->S   Given
    R^W         MP on **1** + **3**
    R           AE on **5**
    (R^!Q)      AI on **2** + **6**
    S           MP on **4** + **7**

Operator Precedence for FOPC (Figure 7.7): !, ^, v, ->, <->

#### FOPC
Extensions to propositional calculus

1. have "terms" that refer to (or represent) objects in the world, e.g. John, Marry, Fido
- propositions now have arguments: married(John, Marry)
- can *quantify* over variables
    * Vx, for all valueable(x) - a "big AND"
        * One **cannot** say VP P(John), this would be 2nd order
    * Ex, exists valueable(x) - a "big OR"
- Functions represent *terms*, **not** truth values
    * motherOf(Aaron Rodgers), motherOf: function, it "represent" a term
    * functions are also terms: motherOf(fatherOf(John))
        * Notes: the arguments to predicates and functions are *terms*

#### To recap
Terms are

1. *constants* such as John, Marry, etc
- *variables*, used in V's and E's
- *functions*, e.g. fatherOf(x)

* we will have one special "in fix" predicate **=**, e.g. Fred=fatherOf(Marry) 
    * <-> is equivalent truth values
    * = is same object
* Note, we could have used equals(Fred, fatherOf(Marry))

        Example: Marry has two sisters, Alice and Sue

* Alice=SisterOf(Marry) ^ Sue=SisterOf(Marry) is **WRONG**
* Instead we can use predicates instead of functions, sisters(Marry, Alice) ^ sisters(Marry, Sue) **RIGHT**

    Examples                WFF (needs to have a *truth value*)

    Mary                    N
    motherOf(John)          N
    motherOf(John, Mary)    Y
    f(p(1)^q(2))            N(no connectives inside function)

#### English-to-FOPC
Everybody knows some body else:
`V x human(x) -> Exists(y) Knows(x, y) ^ human(y) ^ x!=y`

Every rational number is also a real number:
`V x [rational(x) ^ number(x)] -> [real(x) ^ number(x)]`

There is a prime number greater than 100:
`Exists x number(x) ^ prime(x) ^ greater(x, 100)`

*Aside* `Exists x [p(x) -> q(x)]` is same as `Exists x [^p(x) v q(x)]` (would be true if for some **x** p(x) is false)

There is no largest prime
`V x [number(x) ^ prime(x)] -> [Exists y prime(x) ^ number(y) ^ greater(y, x)]`
`! Exists x largest_prime(x)` <- assume too much in the predicate name, which limits interesting

Mary has a sister:

1. sister(mary, sisterOf(mary)) // does not woole if mary has two sisters
- Exists y [sister(mary, y) ^ person(y)]

Mary is the sister of John father

Everybody likes a dog (the same dog or a different dog or some combo?):

* `V x person(x) -> Exists y [dog(y) ^ likes(x, y)]`
* Exists y dog(y) ^ [V x person(x) -> likes(x, y)]

#### Unification Algorithm
* p(John), V x p(x) -> q(x)
    * q(x) <- incorrect, too general
    * q(John) <- OK
    * Theta={x|John} // a binding list
* The unification algorithm finds the fewest constraints that make two logical expression match (i.e. char by char identical)
* all variables are universal(i.e. "for all" variables)




    A       B       Theta(binding list)
    P(?x)   P(Mary) {?x/Mary}
    P(?x)   P(?y)   {?x/?y} or {?y/?x}
    P(?y)   P(?x)   {}
    P(John) P(Mary) FAIL
    P(1)    Q(1)    FAIL since pred or tuneto name
    P(?x?y?z)   P(1,2)  FAIL

##### One Subroutine and One Data structure
    Theta = binding list 
    Substitute(Theta, expression) - repeatedly replace all the bound variables

    subst({?x/John, ?y/Mary}, p(?x, ?y))
    = p(John, Mary, ?z)

    subst({?x/?y, ?y/1}, p(?x, ?y))
    = p(1, 1)

##### Simple Way to do unification
* make sure pred/function names match and H args is the same
* walk through argument-by-argument
    * if can not match fail, e.g. p(sue), p(motherOf(John)) fail
    * otherwise add constraint to Theta
    * replace the bound variable by the matched term in all places (except in Theta)
    * when done, either FAILs or name two identical expression


        Unify(p(?x, ?x, A), p(?z, f(?y), ?y)) Theta={?x/?z, ?z/f(?y), ?y/A} (Aside: "standardizing part" [V x p(x)] [V x q(x)])
        Unify(p(?z, ?z, A), p(?z, f(?y), ?y))
        Unify(p(f(?y), f(?y), A), p(f(?y), f(?y), ?y))
        Unify(p(f(A), f(A), A), p(f(A), f(A), ?y))

##### The "Occurs Check"
* we cannot unify ?x and f(?x)
    * consider ?x and succesorOf(?x): 无限合一，无限迭代，造成死循环

#### Some more Inference Rules for FOPC
- V x P(x) / P(constant): Universal Instantiation (UI) with Theta = {x / constants}
- Exists x P(x) |- P(SkolemConstant+101) (need to generate a **new** constant): Existential Instantiation (EI)
    * V y Exists x P(x) / P(skolemFunction102(?y))
- P(?x, ?y), P(?z, ?w) -> q(?z) |- subst(unify(P(?x, ?y), P(?z, ?w)), q(?z))
    * Alternate Form: replace "P(?z, ?w) -> q(?z)" with "^P(?z, ?w) v q(?z)"
- Generalised Resolution Rule: P(?x, ?y) v alpha(?y, ?z), !P(?a, ?b), beta(?b, ?c, ?d)
|- SUBST(unify(P(?x, ?y), !P(?a, ?b)), alpha(?y, ?z) v beta(?b, ?c, ?d))

        ex> P(?x) v Q(?x), !P(John) v R(John) v Z(Mary, John)
        Using Theta={?x/John}
            Q(John) v R(John) v Z(Mary, John)


##### Unique names assumption
* different constants refer to different objects
* so unique(P(Joe), P(Joseph)) fails even if we tell our AI logic system John=Joseph

#### Clavsal Form (aka, CNF = Conjunctive Normal Form)
* an algorithm exists for putting a set of WFF into this form,
but all you need to know is `P->Q` becomes `!P v Q`
* a conjunct ("AND") of disjuncts ("OR") where the disjuncts only contain atomic predicates or their negations

#### Proof by contradiction
To show alpha, we assume !alpha and show it leads to a contradiction (beta, !beta)
`beta v false, !beta v false |- false v false`

    Given:
    [p(?x1) v !q(?x1)] ^ [r(?x2) v !p(?x2)] ^ [!r(John)] ^ [q(John)] ^ [a(?x3 v !b(?x3)] ^ [!a(Mary)]

    Show r(John):
    Theta={?x3/Mary}
    [p(?x1) v !q(?x1)] ^ [r(?x2) v !p(?x2)] ^ [!r(John)] ^ [q(John)] ^ [!b(Mary)]
    Theta={?x1/John}
    [p(John)] ^ [r(?x2) v !p(?x2)] ^ [!r(John)] ^ [!b(Mary)]
    Theta={?x2/John}
    [p(John)] ^ [!p(John)] ^ [!b(Mary)]
    Theta={}
    [!b(Mary)]

#### Prolog
Prolog does resolution theorem proving, plus can call Std code like in Java.Math class such as add, subtract, etc

#### Negation by failure (to prove true)
If we can not prove **P** assume **!P** (not logically valid, but useful in practice)
    e.g. KB: P->Q, Q->R, a->b
    ASK Prolog: did I write This predicate?: No

#### Semidecidability
If a proof exists, resolution theorem proving will find it. But the code might not halt if Search Space is infinite

#### Key goal of logical reasoning
go beyond **fact lookup** to performing **chains of inference** to answer queries

#### Representing MOVE(x, y) in logic
* Useful BK: V x, s {![Exists y on(y, x, s)]} -> clearTop(x, s)
* V x, y, z, s {block(x) ^ block(y) ^ state(s) ^ clear(x, s) ^ clear(y, s) ^ x!=y ^ on(x, z, s0)}
-> s1 = result(move(x, y), s1) ^ on(x, y, s1) ^ !clearTop(y, s1) ^ clearTop(z, s1)
    * si is timestamp

##### Missed Inference Rule
alpha(constant) |- Exists x alpha(x)

#### Frame Axioms
* stating what is **unchanged** between world states
* "Things not moved, stay where they are."
`V on(z, w, s, x, y) ^ z!=x -> on(z,w, result(move(x, y, s))`

#### [Qualification Problem] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualification_problem)
Will car start?
If gas in tank ^ starter works ^ bananas in tail pipe ^ (where to stop?)

#### [Probability Logic] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_logic) - MLN, Markov Logic Networks
* All WFFs have a weight (if all weights=INFINITE, MLN becomes standard logic)
    * higher the weight, the stronger the WFF
    * sum of weights of all WFFs that are true in this world state

        Prob(world state) = e / z
        ex>
        weight=2 P->Q weight=5 P

        P   Q   Prob in MLN Prob in Pure Logic
        F   F   e**(2+0)/z  0
        F   T   e**(2+0)/z  0
        T   F   e**(0+5)/z  0
        T   T   e**(2+5)/z  1
        where z = e**2 + e**2 + e**5 + e**7
