### Logic
1. Represent world knowledge in logic
- Perform inferences; i.e. deduce what logically follows. Why?

* FOPC, [first order predicate calculus] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic)
    * [Propositional calculus] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus)
    * Seeing if a logical sentence is satisfiable
    * Seeing what logically follows from some give logical sentences
    * well defined
    * sound (inferences are correct)
    * complete (all possible deduction can be mechanically produced)

Components of Propositional Logic
* Atomic sentences: it is cold, it is raining, etc. P, Q, etc (evaluate to TRUE or FALSE)

Connectives create compound sentences
* If P and Q are logical sentences then so are
    * (P) - can add parens
    * ^P - negation
    * P^Q - conjunction
    * PvQ - disjunction
    * P=>Q - implication
    * P<=>Q - equivalence

A grammatically correct logical sentence is a called a well formed formula (WFF)

Truth Tables that Define the Connectiver

P   Q   ^P  P^Q PvQ P->Q(**^PvQ**)  P<->Q

F   F   T   F   F   T               T

F   T   T   F   T   T               F

T   F   F   F   T   F               F

T   T   F   T   T   T               T

R: it is raining, V: take umbrella

* Translate: If it is raining, table your umbrella
* Wrong R^U: it is currently raining and you should take your umbrella
* Right R->: if it is raining, then you should take your umbrella

Some jargon

* a *model* is a "possible world" where the truth value of each primitive is given/specified
* a model of a set of WFF is one that makes all the sentences true
* a **valid** (or [tauta logical] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(logic)#Background)) WFF is true in all world states
* a **satisfiable** WFF is true in at least one world state
* an unsatisfiable WFF is never true

WFF     Valid   Satisfiable Unsatisfiable
P               if p=true
Pv^P    Yes
P^^P                        Yes

Is (P^Q) -> (PvQ) valid, satisfiable or unsatisfiable? show via a truth table

PvQ is the same with [^(P^Q)]v[PvQ]

P   Q   (P^Q)   (PvQ)   P^Q->PvQ

F   F   F       F       T

F   T   F       T       T

T   F   F       T       T

T   T   T       T       T

So (P^Q) -> (PvQ) is valid

Using Search to Find What Lgically Follows
Task: Given WFF1, WFF2 ... WFFn, show WFFz

Viewing as a search space
* using valid logical operatori (i = [1, n])
* Keep going until we add WFFz
