If L separates any pair of words {w1, w2...wn} then if L=L(M) M must have at least n states

* [finite state transducer] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_state_transducer)
* Definition: L sperates strings w, v. if for some u, exactly one of wu, vu is in L.
* Thm: if L=L(M) and Delta*(q0, w)=Delta*(q0, v) then L does not separate w and v
* [deterministic finite automaton] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton)
* If L(M) separates every pair wi, wj(i!=j), then M has at least n states
    * index(L)="number of partitions induced by =-L", language separate, partition
    * [pumping lemma] (http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B3%B5%E5%BC%95%E7%90%86)

### quotes extraction
* [Using machine learning to extract quotes from text] (http://cironline.org/blog/post/using-machine-learning-extract-quotes-text-3687)
#### methods
* regular expressions & pattern matching
    * [on-the-record] (https://github.com/alexredstone/on-the-record)
* machine learning
    * [citizen-quotes] (https://github.com/cirlabs/citizen-quotes) is using [NLTK Maximum Entrophy Classifiers] (http://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/classify/maxent.html) as its ML classifier
        * it is a supervised learning
        * selected six features. Each feature is represented by a function that takes paragraph text as an input and returns either a boolean or categorical variable.
>Does the paragraph contain common attribution words (said, asked, etc.);
>does it contain quote marks;
>does it have a common attribution word within five words of a quote mark (“I love tacos,” Smith said.);
>how many words does it have in quotes (helps deal with the “air quotes” problem);
>what are the five words that fall immediately after a closed quote;
>and what is the last word in the paragraph.
        * maxent figures out the most useful features and weighs them, then value the input paragraph
* [Google inquotes] (http://lingpipe-blog.com/2008/10/01/how-to-extract-quotes-from-the-news/) is a experimental tool which is now under the shelf
