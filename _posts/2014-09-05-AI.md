title: "AI"
---

* engineering approach than algorithm
### Course Main Topics
* Learning from Data
* View problem solving as heruristic search through a large space of possible solutions
* Use probabilistic reasoning and learning
* Use logical reasoning -- representing knowledge about the world in computers
* Neural networks
* Philosophical Foundation of AI

### Class Mottos so far
* Generalize do not memorize
* Let the data decide

### ID3 Algorithms
base cases
* overfitting
* Decision-forests
* Pruning decision-trees



1. no examples left, return majority class at parent as leaf
- all examples same category, return leaf with that category
- no features left, returning majority class in examples as leaf

recursive case
* choose the best feature and use it label an interior node
* recur on each possible value of the chosen feature

The Standard Way to View a ML Task
* fixed-length feature vectors, 99.9% pratical way
