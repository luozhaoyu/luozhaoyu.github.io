### Before RPC
* sockets are the fundamental mechanism with a poor read/write only interface

### Typing
* MPI has explicit type declaration
    * deal recursively with passing the pointer
* Assuming name equivalence (structural equivalence in compiler)

### Centralized Registry
* Services are registered here, binding
* Hard coded address is also an alternative

### Failover
* If the server fails and reboot, the client will retransimit the request with same unique identifier and different sequence number
* The server would ACK every request
    * latency is better than TCP, throughput is worse then TCP
        * very slow in bulk data transferring

### Reviews
* Stubs are customized for every different client and server
