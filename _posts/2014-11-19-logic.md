### Logic
1. Represent world knowledge in logic
- Perform inferences; i.e. deduce what logically follows. Why?

* FOPC, [first order predicate calculus] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic)
    * [Propositional calculus] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus)
    * Seeing if a logical sentence is satisfiable
    * Seeing what logically follows from some give logical sentences
    * well defined
    * sound (inferences are correct)
    * complete (all possible deduction can be mechanically produced)

Components of Propositional Logic
* Atomic sentences: it is cold, it is raining, etc. P, Q, etc (evaluate to TRUE or FALSE)

Connectives create compound sentences
* If P and Q are logical sentences then so are
    * (P) - can add parens
    * ^P - negation
    * P^Q - conjunction
    * PvQ - disjunction
    * P=>Q - implication
    * P<=>Q - equivalence

A grammatically correct logical sentence is a called a well formed formula (WFF)

Truth Tables that Define the Connectiver

P   Q   ^P  P^Q PvQ P->Q(**^PvQ**)  P<->Q

F   F   T   F   F   T               T

F   T   T   F   T   T               F

T   F   F   F   T   F               F

T   T   F   T   T   T               T

R: it is raining, V: take umbrella

* Translate: If it is raining, table your umbrella
* Wrong R^U: it is currently raining and you should take your umbrella
* Right R->: if it is raining, then you should take your umbrella

Some jargon

* a *model* is a "possible world" where the truth value of each primitive is given/specified
* a model of a set of WFF is one that makes all the sentences true
* a **valid** (or [tauta logical] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(logic)#Background)) WFF is true in all world states
* a **satisfiable** WFF is true in at least one world state
* an unsatisfiable WFF is never true

WFF     Valid   Satisfiable Unsatisfiable
P               if p=true
Pv^P    Yes
P^^P                        Yes

Is (P^Q) -> (PvQ) valid, satisfiable or unsatisfiable? show via a truth table

PvQ is the same with [^(P^Q)]v[PvQ]

P   Q   (P^Q)   (PvQ)   P^Q->PvQ

F   F   F       F       T

F   T   F       T       T

T   F   F       T       T

T   T   T       T       T

So (P^Q) -> (PvQ) is valid

Using Search to Find What Lgically Follows
Task: Given WFF1, WFF2 ... WFFn, show WFFz

Viewing as a search space
* using valid logical operatori (i = [1, n])
* Keep going until we add WFFz

* Theorem proving called "model checking" in computer security
* Inference rules

#### Natural Deduction

##### Deduction ins Propositional Calculus
Notation, if we believe these WFF(s) / then these WFF(s) logical follow

##### AND Elimination (AE)
(a1 ^ a2 ^...^ an) / ai, i means All items in an AND are true

##### AND Introduction (AI)
(a1, a2, a3,..., an) / (a1 ^ a2 ^...^ an)

##### OR Introduction (OI)
alpha / (alpha v beta), for any WFF beta

##### Double-Negation Elimination (DNE)
^(^alpha) / alpha

##### Double-Negation Introduction (DNI)
alpha / ^(^alpha)

##### [Modus Ponens (MP)] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens)
(a -> b, a) / b or [(^a v b, a) / b]

##### Unit Resolution (UR)
(a v b, ^b) / a

##### Resolution
* (a v b, ^b v c) / (a v c), via "cast analysis" of b being true of false
* (^a v b, ^b v c) / (^a v c), if we preprocess our "givens" we only need this inference rule

##### Equivalence Elimination (EE)
a <-> b / (a->b) ^ (b->a)

##### Some Implicit Rules
* a ^ b / b ^ a
* a v b / b v a
* a / (a)
* (a) / a

##### Example
Given:

1. P
* !Q
* P->(R ^ W)
* (R ^ !Q)-> S

show **S**:

WFF         Justification

1. P        Given
- !Q        Given
- P->(R^W)  Given
- (R^!Q)->S Given
- R^W       MP on **1** + **3**
- R         AE on **5**
* (R^!Q)    AI on **2** + **6**
- S         MP on **4** + **7**

Operator Precedence for FOPC (Figure 7.7): !, ^, v, ->, <->

#### FOPC
Extensions to propositional calculus

1. have "terms" that refer to (or represent) objects in the world, e.g. John, Marry, Fido
- propositions now have arguments: married(John, Marry)
- can *quantify* over variables
    * Vx, for all valueable(x) - a "big AND"
        * One **cannot** say VP P(John), this would be 2nd order
    * Ex, exists valueable(x) - a "big OR"
- Functions represent *terms*, **not** truth values
    * motherOf(Aaron Rodgers), motherOf: function, it "represent" a term
    * functions are also terms: motherOf(fatherOf(John))
        * Notes: the arguments to predicates and functions are *terms*

#### To recap
Terms are

1. *constants* such as John, Marry, etc
- *variables*, used in V's and E's
- *functions*, e.g. fatherOf(x)

* we will have one special "in fix" predicate **=**, e.g. Fred=fatherOf(Marry) 
    * <-> is equivalent truth values
    * = is same object
* Note, we could have used equals(Fred, fatherOf(Marry))

Example: Marry has two sisters, Alice and Sue

* Alice=SisterOf(Marry) ^ Sue=SisterOf(Marry) is **WRONG**
* Instead we can use predicates instead of functions, sisters(Marry, Alice) ^ sisters(Marry, Sue) **RIGHT**

Examples                WFF (needs to have a *truth value*)

Mary                    N
motherOf(John)          N
motherOf(John, Mary)    Y
f(p(1)^q(2))            N(no connectives inside function)

#### English-to-FOPC
Everybody knows some body else:
`V x human(x) -> Exists(y) Knows(x, y) ^ human(y) ^ x!=y`

Every rational number is also a real number:
`V x [rational(x) ^ number(x)] -> [real(x) ^ number(x)]`

There is a prime number greater than 100:
`Exists x number(x) ^ prime(x) ^ greater(x, 100)`

*Aside* `Exists x [p(x) -> q(x)]` is same as `Exists x [^p(x) v q(x)]` (would be true if for some **x** p(x) is false)

There is no largest prime
`V x [number(x) ^ prime(x)] -> [Exists y prime(x) ^ number(y) ^ greater(y, x)]`
`! Exists x largest_prime(x)` <- assume too much in the predicate name, which limits interesting

Mary has a sister:

1. sister(mary, sisterOf(mary)) // does not woole if mary has two sisters
- Exists y [sister(mary, y) ^ person(y)]

Mary is the sister of John father

Everybody likes a dog (the same dog or a different dog or some combo?):

* `V x person(x) -> Exists y [dog(y) ^ likes(x, y)]`
* Exists y dog(y) ^ [V x person(x) -> likes(x, y)]

#### Unification Algorithm
* p(John), V x p(x) -> q(x)
    * q(x) <- incorrect, too general
    * q(John) <- OK
    * Theta={x|John} // a binding list

The unification algorithm finds the fewest constraints that make two logical expression match (i.e. char by char identical)
