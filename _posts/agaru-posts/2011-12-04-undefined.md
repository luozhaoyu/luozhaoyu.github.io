Sorry,today I have an japanese language exam in Beijing Language and Culture University.I was intended to write a plan about my future study,while after coming back from TsingHua Univeristy,I play some games which is Need for Speed: Most Wanted.

A little tired now.What's more, I'm typing English within Ubuntu, I think I should find a better input method within method for writing my small diaries.

That's all for the day.
