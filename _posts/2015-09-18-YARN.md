### [YARN] (https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cn/opensource/os-cn-hadoop-yarn/)
* [YARN introduction] (http://dongxicheng.org/mapreduce-nextgen/nextgen-mapreduce-introduction/)

#### Scheduling discipline
job has many tasks, one plan is one job, one job is one DAG

* Fairness metric:
    * job-level completion time fairness
    * Dominant resource fairness (max-min)

methods

* Tetris (packing)
* Delay scheduling (queue based)
* Flow-based scheduling
* Capacity scheduling

#### Resource Manager
User would try to run task once and determine how much a resource (e.g., memory) would be used in the future jobs

Tracks overall cluster node resources

1. list of containers
- resource requirements
- locality preferences
- priority ordering among requests

### Queue based Scheduler
application tasks are put in container queue, and replicated in rack queue, and cluster queue

[Hadoop Fair Scheduler] (http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/FairScheduler.html)

#### Origin Hadoop Fair Scheduler
get per job limit on the number of tasks scheduled (this is called sticky slot)

#### Delay scheduling
* do not unblock job immediately (wait for a while)
* if number of tasks > threshold, time-out

#### Flow based scheduling

#### Dominant Resource Fairness (multiple resources, jobs may differs in the resources they execute)
Equalize shares of dominant resources across jobs. e.g., some jobs takes too much memory, some jobs takes too much IO, could put these complementary demands together

### [Tetris] (http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/UM/redmond/projects/tetris/index.html) is a cluster scheduler that packs tasks
* [PPT] (http://www.slideserve.com/iorwen/multi-resource-packing-for-cluster-schedulers)
* minimizes makespan
    * average completion, SRPT (shortest remaining processing time)
        * trading-off packability for minimize average completion time
        * SRPT: jobs: remaining time (l) in job
            * l is weighted, if weight increase, it would converge to SRPT
    * fairness: DRF: pick 1 job farthest away from DRF
        * pick from a set of candidates rather than pick from only 1 candidate (it is DRF)
* pick machine, task pair with highest product `<task CPU, memory> * <available CPU, memory>`
