### Consistency model
* defined, undefined, consistent, inconsistent

### Reviews
* Application must cope with possible duplicates
* Not POSIX compliant
* No caching of data: streaming reads and appends are quick
* Checksum must be used along with Record Append
    * File contents must be verified to avoid inconsistent regions, repeated appends
