### NFS
Why we need NFS?

* Sharing/collaboration
* access data from anywhere
* have many clients -> server scaling problem
* administration/ security

NFS

* simple/ fast server crash recovery

#### Architecture of generic distributed filesystem
translate local `read() write()` over network so that remote server could understand


#### NFS protocol
* **stateless**: server does not track information about clients, e.g., who they are, what they cache
    * each client request has all info needed to serve request
    * upon failure: client retry
* File handler:
    * local file handler: <volume ID, inode NO, [generation NO] (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11071996/what-are-inode-generation-numbers)>
        * generation NO: in case the server restart, then assgin different inode NO to same object

        read(fh, offset, size)
        write(fh, data, offset, size)
        fh := lookup(parent_fh, name)

#### Filesystem API
`open("/foo/bar.txt", O_RDONLY)` while foo is root local mounted:

1. client `lookup(root_fh, "bar.txt"` in server
- server return file_descriptor of "bar.txt"

`read(fd, ...)`: send request to server, server read that for client

#### Failure
* key: idempotency (performing action N times == perform 1 time)
* client retry
    * have to be smart about retry

#### Problem
* remote is slower than local
    * client cache in memory
* Visibility: client B has write buffer for writing, so that other clients could not see update of B
    * flush dirty pages from client upon file close
* Stateless
    * before using a file (maybe in local cache), check if file has been modified (ask server use `getattr()`)
* Attribute cache
    * trust contents of this cache for period of time (e.g., 3 seconds)
