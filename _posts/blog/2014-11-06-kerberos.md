title: "Kerberos"

### Attacks
* tapping
* spurious messages injection
* replay

### Design considerations
* No passwords are communicated over the network
* Cryptographic protection against spoofing
* Limited period of validity
* Timestamps to prevent replay attacks
    * timestamp is a sequence number
* Mutual Authentication
    * if client wants server to prove its identity, the server could reply the new_timestamp = timestamp + 1

### Open Problems
* How to decide the correct lifetime for a ticket
* How to allow proxies
* How to guarantee workstation integrity
* Constant availability of a TRUSTED Ticket Granting Server
* Authenticity of servers is dependent on a trust relationship between the KDC and every server
* Requires timely transactions
* Subverted workstation can save and replay user passwords
* Vulnerable to Simple Password Attacks
* Scalability is an issue
* Every object has to be "Kerberized"

### Reviews
* Why Authentication Services separates from Ticket Granting Services
    * prevent fake user get the real ticket, so we should let the client to decrypt the Ticket Granting Ticket firstly
* Why we need an authenticator besides the ticket
    * the ticket just shows person A has been granted the permission, but you could not assume the ticket holder is person A
        * the client could create the authenticator by itself easily
    * the ipaddr in the ticket is not useful: it assumes that the client could not move with a fixed ip

### Notes
* Distribute shared secret to right people
* Who do you trust?
    * devices are not trustworthy
* What if publish the public key?
    * others may fake your public key
        * need third party or key distribution service
