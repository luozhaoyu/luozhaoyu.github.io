title: "Spark Tez"
---

### Spark
* RDDs - transformations
* Dependencies - narrow / wide
* persist(), checkpoint
    * schedulable blocks
    * maximal sequence of storage with narrow dependency

### Tez
`App(Hive) -> DAG(Calcite) -> AM(Vertex Manager) --physical DAG--> YARN`

* Dryad -> Tez -> REEF
* What Tez provides (what apps do)
* What is interesting about Tez
    * Built-in instantiation
        * security/isolation
        * built-in performance optimization
        * fault tolerance, stragglers
        * scheduling, resource negotiation
    * Dataplane-specific
    * Computation logic structure
    * Partitioning
* DAG API
    * create a rich work flow
* Runtime API
    * Processor -> program runs in each task corresponding to vertex
        1. initialize(context)
        - run(list<input>, list<output>)
        - handle_events() -> taskfinish
        - interm.ouput(read/write)
    * Output
        1. Init(context)
        - writes()
        - handle_events()
    * Input
        1. Input
        - Init()
        - Reads()
        - handle_events()

#### DAG
what could not be converted to DAG? loop, recursive query
##### Vertex
core application logic: "processor"

* can map to many "tasks"
* parallelism <- static / dynamically controlled by a vertex manager

##### Edges
* connectivity pattern
    * one-one
    * broadcast
    * scatter-gather
* transport mechanism
* scheduling
    * sequential (downstream node's run may be blocked by previous)
    * concurrent
* Data source
    * persisted
    * ephemeral
