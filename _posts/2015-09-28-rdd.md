#### RDD
* read-only, partitioned collection of records
* a restricted form of shared memory
* coarse-grained transformations (e.g., map, filter and join) rather than fine-grained updates to shared state
* **reuse** intermediate results during **iterative** in memory not in external stable storage
* immutable data: could run bakcup copies of slow tasks to ease stragglers
* can schedule tasks based on data locality
* RDD degrade gracefully when memory is not enough, while DSM may get block
* RDD is best suited for **batch** applications that apply the **same** operation to all elements of a dataset
* general-purpose programming language

##### What RDD can't in shared state
* asynchronous
* fine-grained updates


##### RDD fault tolerance efficiency
* lineage logs the transformations used to build it
* recompute from missing partition

##### RDD lazy
* only compute when the first time they are used in an action, so that it can pipeline transformations
* gain more times to do optimizations before executing

#### RDD representing
1. a set of partitions, which are atomic pieces of the dataset
- a set of dependencies on parent RDDs
- a function for computing the dataset based on its parents
- metadata about its partitioning scheme
- data placement

##### RDD dependencies
* narrow dependencies: each partition of the parent RDD is used by **at most one** partition of the child RDD
* wide dependencies: multiple child partitions may depend on it
    * checkpointing is useful for long lineage graphs containing wide dependencies
