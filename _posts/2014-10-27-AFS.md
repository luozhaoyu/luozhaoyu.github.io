### Protocol
* NFS: clients check with server periodically
    * AFSv1 also has this problem, too many TestAuth

#### AFSv1
* only cache file contents, directories are only kept at the server

##### Problems
* Path-traversal costs are too high
* The client issues too many TestAuth protocol messages
* Imbalanced server loads
    * use volumes, move volumes around
* Too many context switches in server
    * use thread instaed of multi-process

#### AFSv2
* install *callback* at server to reduce TestAuth communications
* *file identifier (FID)*: a volume identifier, a file identifier and a "uniquifier"

### Consistency
* [Weak consistency] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_consistency)
    * All accesses to syncronization variables are seen by all processes in the same order (sequentially)
    * All accesses to other variables may be seen in different order on different processes
    * Operations in between synchronization operations is the same in each process
* When the file is opened, a client will generally receive the latest consistent copy from the server
    * NFS caches blocks rather than whole files, caches in memory rather than in local disk
* last writer wins: processes in different machines who is the last one close the file would overwrite the server file
    * NFS would get a mixed block file

### Crash Recovery
* clients would try to send TestAuth before fetch when client or server is down

### Vital features
* Scalability
    * AFS file is fetched from server and cached on the local disk of a workstation, further references are directed to the local cache copy
    * Any modification is promptly sent to the server
    * Local disk is used as a persistent cache by AFS
* Security
    * User password could obtain security token, which could be used to establish secure network connections later
    * ACL
    * Everything within cable is encrypted
* Simplified System Administration
    * Only servers need backup, workstation disks are merely caches

### Reviews
* cluster stores only file paths

#### disadvantage
