### Why GraphX?
* Specialized graph processing systems:
    * Graph processing systems often abandon fault tolerance in favor of snapshot recovery to pursuit performance
    * On-disk processing (e.g., MapReduce) is not suit for **iterative** graph algorithms
* Early distributed dataflow frameworks
    * Directly implementing iterative graph algorithms using dataflow operators can be challenging
    * Did not expose fine-grained control over the data partitioning

### GraphX
* Essential dataflow patterns: **join-map-group-by** dataflow operators
* Define computation at the granularity of vertices and their neighborhoods and exploit the sparse dependency structure pre-defined by the graph
    * general-purpose distributed dataflow frameworks define computation at granularity of individual items (e.g., filter, map) or across entire collections (e.g., non-broadcast join which requires a shuffle)
* Enables **composition** of graphs with unstructured and tabular data
* Same physical data could be viewed as a graph or collections
* Focus on bulk-synchronous model and rely on system level techniques (e.g., pipelining and speculation) to address stragglers

#### Property Graph Data Model
* Single property graph with a pre-declared, sparse structure
    * Dataflow system's operators (e.g., join) span multiple collections
    * can be logically represented as a pair of vertex and edge property collections
    * Edges, Vertices, Routing Table

#### Partitioning
* vertex-cut (in contrast to edge-cut) partitioning as horizontally partition

#### Fault Tolerance
* logical partitioning
* lineage

#### Optimizations
* GAS Decomposition: split vertex programs into: Gather, Apply, Scatter
    * a pull-based model of message computation: the system asks the vertex program for value between adjacent vertices rather user sending
* Graph Partitioning: vertex-cut partitioning
* Mirror Vertices: if multiple neighbors are on the same remote machine: send a single message to that machine and then let it to be forwarded to all the neighbors
* Active Vertices
