### Hive
    SQL on Hadoop or Spark
    Hive - MR/Tez
    SparkSQL - Spark
    Impala


1. Tailoring to excution engine
- General query optimization + some other optimization

query optimization procedure

1. SQL query (what is different from SQL) (original Hive paper just talks this)
    * partitioned table
    * map, reduce programs
    * No insert, delete modify
    * Distributed By vs Sort By
- parser (AST)
- semantic analysis (offline information stored in metastore)
    * CBO optiq/calcite
    * join ordering
- logical optimizer
    * predicate pushdown
    * simplification of predicates
- physical optimize
    * take out unnecessary map
    * pipeline map into same stage
    * take out unnecessary Reduce Sink Operators
- execution framework (Tez/MR)
- Answer

#### Data format
* ORC file
    * faster some query performance
    * storage efficiency
        * data type specified approaches to compress individual columns
            * need compress/uncompress when write/read column data
    * column oriented
    * strip data:
        * stored in columnar format
        * align with HDFS blocks
    * Index: statiscitcs about table, stripe, index-group
        1. position pointer
        - min, max, avg, cardinality, number of distinct values, length of data TD
            * find the minium selectivity for join order
            * pruning unnecessary reduces
            * skipping unnecessary index groups
* DataFrame
* Parquet

#### CBO
* Join-order selection
    * Greedily
    * Exhaustive search
* Join algorithm
    * sort-merge: big shuffle foot print
    * one of the tables is small
        * broadcast join
        * hash(small) - map join
        * [semi-join] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_join#Hash_right_semi-join)
* Simplifications

#### DAG
* different nodes do: join, map
* Reduce Sink Operators
    * re-partition data: aligh with downstream operation

#### Tree optimization
* pipeline multiple small map-joins into one task
* eliminate unnecessary RSOps, FileSops
