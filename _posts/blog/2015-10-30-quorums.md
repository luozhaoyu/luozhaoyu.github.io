### Blocking
coordinator and server could block -> we don't need all reply, majority reply is enough

### Quorums
* key idea: 抽屉原理
* adds: state info (e.g., timestamp) per data item
    * coordinator generates logical timestamp

#### 2PC protocol
* How to make it quorum based?
    * read: find the latest timestamp among R servers
    * write: lock W servers and commit successfully
* How is changing the read/write quorum size useful?
* Strength and weakness of quorum(problems solved/not solved)
    * coordinator down is critical
        * this blocking problem has not been completed solved
