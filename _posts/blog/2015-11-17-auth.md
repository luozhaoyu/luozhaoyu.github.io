### What "secure" means?
* Confidentiality
* Authentication
* Integrity. Intruder can change message
* Accountability. No party can deny sending message
* Availability (DoS)

### Crypto introduction
* Symmetric-Key crypto: algorithm is open and public
* Asymmetric-Key crypto: public and private key
* Hash (MD5, SHA1): msg -> digest

#### Attack Model
* Intrude between parties
    * replay msg
        * give a nonce (randomly generated for once use) change everytime, e.g., ID, so it would not be done again
    * copy msg
    * alter msg
    * send false msg

### Symmetric-Key Auth
* A and B are who they claim to be
* Confidentiality

### Digital Signatures
* use same hash function to generate message digest
    * CS = Hash(msg) encrypted by Private_keyA before sending
    * CSC = Hash(msg) encrypted by Shared_keyCK in sending
